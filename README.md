## CS2 Project 3: Creating a class
Choose an item of interest that exists in the physical world. Draft your idea in pseudo code. Once your choice has been reviewed with the class and approved by me, create a series of useful classes in python, including relevant states and methods. You should use the properties of inheritance and encapsulation to drive your design decision making.
Come prepared next class to share your pseudo code with the class.
Using the classes you created in pseudo code, you will now write the code to make them operational. 

Your program should use inheritance and the basic principles of good OOP design. Test your program thoroughly to ensure that each method is returning the desired results.
